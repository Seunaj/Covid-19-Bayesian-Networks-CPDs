# Covid-19 Bayesian Networks
This repo contains the codes for generating the Bayesian network structure and the conditional probability distributions (CPDs) of COVID-19 severity variables based on data collected from the CDC for 25 states in US. It serves the purpose of expanding the applicability of Bayesian networks and machine learning for post-detection analysis.
