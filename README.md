# Covid-19 Bayesian Networks
This repo contains the codes for generating the Bayesian network structure and the conditional probability distributions (CPDs) of COVID-19 severity variables based on data collected from the CDC for 25 states in US. It serves the purpose of expanding the applicability of Bayesian networks and machine learning for post-detection analysis.

* Bayesian Net.ipynb -> This file contains the code for which the bayesian network and CPDs are generated from the COVID-19 dataset. To be able to read the CPDs, it is recommended that you download the file and/or open in a jupyter notebook.

* CPD plots.ipynb -> It is used to plot the CPDs of some severity variables to interpretability.

* DSID model.ipynb -> Contains code for designing the supervised ML model architecture (using Tensorflow and Keras framework) and plots the metrics for comparison.
